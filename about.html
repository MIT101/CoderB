<h3>Animals that are going extinct</h3>
<h2>1. Hedgehogs</h2>

<p> As Fiona Matthews, chair of the Mammal Society and professor at the University of Sussex, said: “I’m not saying they [the hedgehog] are going to go extinct in the next five years and actually it’s quite difficult to put a precise number on it, just as we can’t put a precise number on it for a lion or a tiger.

“What we’re saying is that the trajectory of travel is such that if we don’t do something really radical, a lot bolder, then yes, these species that were taken for granted… they are going to end up with our grandchildren not being able to see them.”</p>

<h2>2. Foxs</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, all flying foxes live on islands, and all of them are going extinct. In Australia, laws have been enacted to curb hunting of these animals, but invasive species are still decimating them. The foxy island dwellers have nowhere to go when they are threatened by hunting or habitat loss. Their boundaries are the seas that surround them.<p>

<h2>3. Dogs</h2>

<p>A new report shows that the population of dogs, mainly bigger dogs are rapidly going down.
Smaller dogs show a decline also, but it is found more common in big dogs. This was found November 8th, 2020. Stay updated with articles,
the today show, and any other news programs or hand held news prints if you love our furry friends.</p>

<h2>4. Cat<h2>
<img src="images/cat.jpg"/>
<p>The world's least-known feline, the endangered flat-headed cat, has fewer than 2,500 mature individuals left in the wild. Destruction of the wetlands on which they depend, in their home range of the inland peat swamps and mangrove forests of Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia, has led to the loss of flat-headed cats. It formerly inhabited Thailand as well but is thought to be extinct now. The loss of habitat — mostly due to conversion into palm oil plantations — may mean it will disappear along with the forest.</p>
